Scrum Meeting 14:

Local storage for comments, adding the comment first to local storage then adding it to the comment box div, removing the entry to put in another comment. Mock data, loop through data and create a function that dynamically stores and build the topic divs on html. Say something form pull data from the entries and add to the mock data, then dynamically store to the topics. Sort topic buttons will sort topics anbd popular topics will link to entries regarding that specific topic.

Christian, Zak, and Talon: Finish building mock data and implement sort, display, loop

Scrum Meeting 15:

Presentation was finished and uploaded to google slides. LocalStorage works comment box works, however still need to find a way to add the data to the div from localStorage.Currently removes the textarea, creates a new div, but still needs to be linked to a the send button and apply CSS to new div.

Zak: Refine presentation
Zedrick and Jomari: Finish local storage

Scrum Meeting 16:

localStorage is working but still needs refinements. Comments still need to be pulled form localStorage, button does work but does is not linked up to the function. getElementById is not working, therefore, we can't shrink the height of the other comments once a new one is added. Presentation has been finalized and speech id being worked on.

Zak: Work on presentation speech
Zedrick and Jomari: localStorage comments
